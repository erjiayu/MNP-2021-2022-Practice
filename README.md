# MNP-2021-2022-Practice

## Introduction

Hi everyone! This is our practice repository for the 2021-2022 Software team. Here, you can practice some basic skills that you will use across various software and electrical projects. 

## Exercises
1. Edit this README file. Include a sentence at the bottom of the file with your name, major, and an unpopular food opinion you have. 
2. Make a branch in this repository. Make sure to include your name in the branch name. In the branch, add a .txt file with a couple sentences about why you're interested in joining MNP and what you want to learn. Don't stress too much about this, just keep it short and simple. 
3. Once you are done making edits to your branch, commit your changes and add a comment with your name and date. 
4. After all of your changes are made, make a pull request to merge your branch to the main branch. 
5. If interested, try these exercises using the command line.

1. Hi! I'm Tara and I'm a CS sophomore! 
=======
My name is Joe Ghezzi and I'm a freshman with an undecided major. My unpopular food opinion is that cereal most certainly is a type of soup.

My name is Lucas Chen, a prospective CS major through LSA. An unpopular food opinion I have is that ramen is overrated and is just really salty.
